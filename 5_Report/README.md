## Introduction

on February 17, 1869, a Russian professor of chemistry, Dimitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, completed the first of his numerous periodic charts. Later on the Periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements by increasing atomic number. Each chemical element has a particular feature and the atomic number comes from the amount of tiny particles called PROTONS in each atom of the element.
