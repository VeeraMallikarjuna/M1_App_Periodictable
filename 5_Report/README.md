## Introduction

on February 17, 1869, a Russian professor of chemistry, Dimitri Ivanovich Mendeleev, completed the first of his numerous periodic charts. Later on the Periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements by increasing atomic number. Each chemical element has a particular feature and the atomic number comes from the amount of tiny particles called PROTONS in each atom of the element.
## Features
The main Theme of this project is to give information about the Modern Periodic Table and it is very useful for students who are related to chemistry background. To use the knowledge of the periodic table to solve problems in health, technology, agriculture, environment & education.

## Art Of Work
It is based on modern periodic table.
By giving the Atomic Name of the elememt, it shows the symbol ,number ,and weight of that element.

## 4W - 1H

WHY- The periodic table is important to provide a great deal of information about elements and how they relate to one another. The table can be used to predict the properties of elements.

WHAT- output of this code is atomic name,symbol etc.,

WHEN- If the user wants to know the atomic properties of the element.

WHERE- Laboratories and Educational Institutions.

HOW- This Application is Implemented Using Basic C.

## SWOT Analysis

#### Strength
Easy To Understand and It is Useful to get Valid Information.

#### Weakness
The output only comes when you give the valid atomic name.

## High Level Requirements:
The starting Letter of the Atomic Name must be capital.
You should know the Name of the Element.
## Low Level Requirements:
NO need of atomic weight and number of that element.
