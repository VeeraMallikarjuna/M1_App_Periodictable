## Features
The main Theme of this project is to give information about the Modern Periodic Table and it is very useful for students who are related to chemistry background.
To use the knowledge of the periodic table to solve problems in health, technology, agriculture, environment & education.
## Art Of Work
* It is based on modern periodic table.
* By giving the Atomic Name of the elememt, it shows the symbol ,number ,and weight of that element.
## 4W - 1H
WHY- The periodic table is important to provide a great deal of information about elements and how they relate to one another. The table can be used to predict the properties of elements.

WHAT- output of this code is atomic name,symbol etc.,

WHEN- If the user wants to know the atomic properties of the element.

WHERE- Laboratories and Educational Institutions.

HOW- This Application is Implemented Using Basic C.

## High Level Requirements:
* The starting Letter of the Atomic Name must be capital.
* You should know the Name of the Element.

## Low Level Requirements:
* NO need of atomic weight and number of that element.
